            <p>Computer science is the theory, experimentation, 
                and engineering that form the basis for the design 
                and use of computers. It involves the study of algorithms
                 that process, store, and communicate digital information. 
                 A computer scientist specializes in the theory of 
                 computation and the design of computational systems. 
                 Its fields can be divided into a variety of theoretical 
                 and practical disciplines. Some fields, such as computational
                  complexity theory (which explores the fundamental properties 
                  of computational and intractable problems), are highly abstract, 
                  while fields such as computer graphics emphasize real-world 
                  visual applications. 
                  Other fields focus on challenges in implementing computation. 
                  For example, programming language theory considers various 
                  approaches to the description of computation, while the study 
                  of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of 
                  the use of programming languages and complex systems. 
                  Human窶田omputer interaction considers the challenges in making 
                  computers and computations useful, usable, and universally 
                  accessible to humans. </p>
